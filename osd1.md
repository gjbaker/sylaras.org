These are unpublished 13-plex t-CyCIF images of formalin fixed and
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens from four patients with
BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma resected prior to (left) and after
(right) treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors
(dabrafenib/trametinib). Each image is composed of 150-200 image tiles
at a nominal resolution of ~0.9 micron. Different sets of markers can
be highlighted using the tool at the top right. In the “tumor
architecture” view for example, green (S100) represents tumor cells,
white represents immune cells (CD45RO) and red the stroma (alpha
smooth muscle actin). Blue (Hoechst 33342) marks cell nuclei (DNA) in
all views.

Images are stored on Amazon S3 and the zoomable image viewer
implemented using OpenSeaDragon.

These specimens were retrieved from the archives of the Brigham and
Women’s Hospital under a discarded/excess tissue protocol as detailed
in Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol IRB17-1688 (2018) for
research deemed to “involve no more than minimal risk to the
subjects.”
