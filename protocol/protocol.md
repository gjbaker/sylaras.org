**Antibody Titration.** Immunolabeling concentrations yielding the
highest staining index (SI)^55^ for each antibody in the study were
determined by first harvesting the spleens of two 12-week-old female
C57BL/6J mice placed under terminal anesthesia with a dose of 150 mg/kg
of ketamine hydrochloride and 20 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride diluted in
sterile 0.9% NaCl delivered with a 1 mL tuberculin syringe equipped with
a 26G needle as a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Using
opposing frosted ends of 2 glass microscope slides, each spleen was
gently macerated and rinsed with 4 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 into a
60 x 15 mm polystyrene petri dish on ice. Splenocytes were aspirated
from the dish, dispensed into a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuged at
350 x g (max RCF) for 10 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended
in 8 mL of a 1X ACK lysing buffer and placed on ice for 5 minutes to
lyse red blood cells (RBCs). Six (6) mL of flow buffer + azide was added
to the tube prior to filtering the cell suspension through a 40 μm nylon
mesh into a fresh 15 mL conical tube. Splenocytes were again centrifuged
at 350 x g (max RCF) for 10 minutes at 4°C then resuspended in 2 mL of
flow buffer + azide. Cell counting was performed using a trypan blue and
a glass hemocytometer. Cell concentration was adjusted accordingly to
achieve a final concentration of 1x10^7^ cells/mL.

Two-hundred (200) μL of the 1x10^7^ cell/mL splenocyte suspension were
added to wells A-H of 11 concentric columns of a 96-well V-bottom
microplate using a multichannel pipette followed by centrifugstion at
100 x g (max RCF) for 3 minutes at 4°C. One-hundred and fifty (150) μL
of cell supernatant was aspirated from each well followed by
resuspension in 100 μL of Fc block (15 μg/mL final concentration).
Splenocytes were incubated on ice for 5 minutes prior to centrifugation
at 100 x g (max RCF) for 3 minutes at 4°C. One-hundred (100) μL was
aspirated from each well before resuspension with 100 μL of target
antibodies pre-diluted in Brilliant Stain Buffer to achieve the
following two-fold serial dilution series per column for each of the 11
antibodies used in the study: 24, 12, 6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.1875
μg/mL. Splenocytes were immunolabeled on ice for 15 minutes in the dark
prior to centrifugation at 100 x g (max RCF) for 3 minutes at 4°C.
Two-hundred (200) μL of supernatant were then aspirated followed by
resuspension with 100 μL of flow buffer + azide. This washing step was
repeated once except that 200 μL (instead of 100 μL) of flow buffer +
azide was used in the resuspension step. DAPI was added to each well at
a final concentration of 1μg/mL and allowed to incubate for 3-5 minutes
prior to data acquisition.

Immunolabeled splenocytes were analyzed on a BD LSR II SORP flow
cytometer equipped with a BD HTS for 96-well high-throughput sampling.
The following acquisition gating strategy was used: (FSC-A vs. SSC-A) →
(SSC-H vs. SSC-W) → (FSC-H vs. FSC-W) → (DAPI-A vs. FSC-A) → (CD~x~ vs.
count). A total of 10,000 viable singlets were analyzed per well. The
median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of the first (background) and
second (first true positive) peaks, and the 84^th^ percentile of the
first peak were identified using the layout editor tool of FlowJo
software from which a SI for each antibody was calculated according to
the following formula: SI =
(MFI~pos~-MFI~neg~)/\[(84%~neg~-MFI~neg~)/0.995\]. The maximum SI
(SI~max~) of each antibody was used as the target immunolabeling
concentration in our longitudinal study.

**Tissue Harvesting and Processing.** The following disposable reagents
were gathered and labeled before each of our study’s 3 time points:

-   15 mL conical tubes (16)

<!-- -->

-   labeled: “blood”, &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;replicate&gt; (note:
    &lt; &gt; indicates a variable)

<!-- -->

-   3 mL syringes equipped with 23G needles (16)

<!-- -->

-   labeled: “marrow”, &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;replicate&gt;

<!-- -->

-   1 mL tuberculin syringes equipped with 26G needles (17)

<!-- -->

-   \(16) labeled: “blood”, &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;replicate&gt;

-   \(1) unlabeled: used for injectable anesthesia

<!-- -->

-   60 x 15 mm polystyrene petri dishes (64)

<!-- -->

-   labeled: &lt;tissue&gt; (excluding blood), &lt;condition&gt;,
    &lt;replicate&gt;

-   4 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 was added to each dish

<!-- -->

-   0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (80)

<!-- -->

-   labeled: &lt;tissue&gt;, &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;replicate&gt;

One-hundred (100) μL of a 10% EDTA solution was added to each 15 mL
conical tube. Four (4) mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 was added to each 60
x 15 mm polystyrene petri dish with the exception of those labeled
“marrow”, to which only 2 mL of supplemented media was added (the other
2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 was to be placed into each of the (16) 3
mL syringes). One-hundred ninety-eight (198) μL of flow buffer was added
to each microcentrifuge tube. Fifty (50) μL of a 10% EDTA solution was
added to each 1 mL tuberculin syringe to coat the inner barrel with EDTA
by operating the plunger several times. All conical tubes, petri dishes,
3 mL syringes, and microcentrifuge tubes were stored on ice or at 4°C.

Sixteen (16) mice were terminally anesthetized in series with a 150
mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride and 20 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride
diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCl delivered with the unlabeled 1 mL
tuberculin syringe as a single i.p. injection. Refer to accompanying
spreadsheet for preparation details (**Supplementary Table 2**). Once
non-responsive to both toe and tail pinch, each mouse was pinned ventral
side up to an extruded polystyrene foam block by its front and hind paws
using four 26G needles and sprayed down with 70% EtOH to prevent fur
from entering the dissection cavity. Lymphoid organs were harvested in
the following order: blood, thymus, spleen, superficial/deep cervical
lymph nodes, bone marrow. *Blood*: after making a “y” incision from the
gut to the rib cage to expose the heart, whole blood was aspirated from
the right ventricle directly into one of the aforementioned EDTA-coated
1 mL tuberculin syringes. The needle was removed before expelling blood
into its respectively labeled 15 mL conical tube stored on ice. Each
mouse was then transcardially perfused with heparinized and oxygenated
(95% O~2~/5% CO~2~) Tyrode’s solution at a rate of 4.0 mL/minute for at
least 2 minutes in a laminar flow hood to fully exsanguinate the
circulatory system. The method for mouse transcardial perfusion has been
described in detail elsewhere^51^. *Thymus*: Once exsanguinated, each
mouse was returned to the extruded polystyrene foam block for thymus
excision with small dissection scissors and fine-tipped bent forceps
being careful to remove any contaminating adipose and the mediastinal
lymph nodes. Thymi were placed into respectively labeled 60 x 15 mm
polystyrene petri dishes on ice. *Spleen*: Spleens were excised using
small dissection scissors and fine-tipped bent forceps and placed into
respectively labeled 60 x 15 mm polystyrene petri dishes on ice.
*Superficial/deep cervical lymph nodes*: Lymph nodes were dissected
under a dissection microscope using small dissection scissors and
fine-tipped bent forceps. Excised nodes were placed into respectively
labeled 60 x 15 mm polystyrene petri dishes on ice. *Bone marrow*: The
right hind limb of each mouse was removed using bone cutters.
Musculature and tendons were stripped away from the femur and tibia and
the proximal and distal epiphyses of each bone were removed using a
single-edged razor blade. Marrow from the two bones was flushed into the
respectively labeled 60 x 15 mm polystyrene petri dish on ice using the
2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 in the respectively labeled 3 mL syringe.
Flushed marrow was gently aspirated and expelled back into the petri
dish one time to facilitate cell dissociation.

Thymi, spleens, and cervical lymph nodes were macerated using opposing
frosted ends of 2 glass microscope slides which were dipped into the 4
mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 of the respectively labeled 60 x 15 mm
polystyrene petri dish to collect as may cells as possible. Plastic
Pasteur pipettes were used to transfer lymph nodes onto the frosted end
of one glass microscope slide for maceration. A fresh pair of slides
were used for each tissue to prevent sample cross-contamination. Five
(5) mL of ice-cold DPBS was added to each petri dish prior to filtering
each cell suspension through a fresh 40 μm nylon mesh into respectively
labeled 15 mL conical tubes on ice using a fresh 10 mL serological
pipette for every sample. Filtered samples were centrifuged at 400 x g
(max RCF) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Cell supernatants were aspirated and
each pellet was resuspend in 4 mL of a 1X ACK lysing buffer using a
fresh 5 mL serological pipette for each sample to avoid
cross-contamination. Samples were placed on ice for 5 minutes to lyse
RBCs. Tissue samples were centrifuged at 400 x g (max RCF) for 10
minutes at 4°C, had their supernatants aspirated, and their cells
resuspended in flow buffer + azide using the following volumes: 1000 μL
for thymi; 1000 μL for spleens; 200 μL for bone marrow; 100 μL for
deep/superficial cervical lymph nodes.

Blood samples were next lysed by adding 10 mL of 1X ACK lysing buffer to
each 15 mL polypropylene conical tube. Tubes were placed back on ice for
5 minutes (or until blood color changed from dark burgundy to bright
red). Blood samples were then centrifuged at 400 x g (max RCF) for 10
minutes at 4°C, their supernatants aspirated, and their WBC pellets
resuspended with 200 μL of flow buffer + azide. Samples were stored on
ice.

Two (2) μL of each tissue sample were then added to the 198 μL of flow
buffer (a 1:100 dilution) in the respectively labeled 0.5 mL
microcentrifuge tubes using a P20 micropipette equipped with a gel
loading tip. Ten (10) μL of each 1:100 dilution was further diluted 1:1
with a 0.4% trypan blue solution. Ten (10) μL of the resultant solution
was then used to estimate cell number using a brightfield microscope and
a glass hemocytometer. Typical cell yields were as follows: 3x10^5^ –
1x10^6^ cells from the blood; 3x10^7^ – 8x10^7^ cells from the spleen;
6x10^7^ – 8x10^7^ from the thymus; 6x10^6^ – 1.5x10^7^ from the combined
deep/superficial cervical lymph nodes; 9x10^6^ – 1.5x10^7^ from the bone
marrow. Cell counts were recorded in an spreadsheet which returned the
volume of additional flow buffer + azide required per sample to achieve
a final concentration of approximately 2x10^7^ cells/mL (**Supplementary
Table 2**). Because mouse blood typically contained less than 2x10^6^
total cells, the 200 μL volume of each blood sample was simply split
between the respective experimental well and the CD49b single-positive
compensation control well (**see Supplementary Fig. 2e for plate
details**).

**Immunolabeling.** The following disposable reagents were gathered and
labeled before each of our study’s 3 time points:

-   1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (12)

<!-- -->

-   labeled in duplicate: &lt;target antibody or CD45 isotype&gt;

-   tubes were placed into a microcentrifuge tube rack on ice

<!-- -->

-   12-well V-bottom reagent reservoir (1)

<!-- -->

-   individual compartments labeled: &lt;target antibody or CD45
    isotype&gt;

-   15 mL conical tubes (2)

<!-- -->

-   one labeled “cocktail”, the other labeled “FVD”

-   placed on ice

Dilutions of each antibody (1:10) were prepared using the 12
microcentrifuge tubes. Refer to accompanying spreadsheet for preparation
details (**Supplementary Table 2**). From these 1:10 dilutions,
antibodies were further diluted in the respective wells of a 12-well
V-bottom reagent reservoir to achieve 100 μL volumes at the final
antibody concentration to immunolabel the cells of each single-color
compensation control. The remaining 1:10 antibody dilutions were used to
prepare a master mix of combined target antibodies (excluding the CD45
isotype) placed in the 15 mL tube labeled “cocktail”. All final antibody
dilutions were stored on ice in the dark.

One-hundred (100) μL aliquots of each cell suspension were added to the
wells of a 96-well V-bottom microplate using a multichannel pipette
according to the plate layout specified in (**Supplementary Fig. 2e**).
The plate was then centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 6 minutes at
4°C. Fifty (50) μL of supernatant was aspirated and cells were
resuspended with 100 μL of Fc block (15 μg/mL final concentration) the
total volume of which was determined using the spreadsheet
(**Supplementary Table 2**). Cells were blocked on ice for 5 minutes
before being centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Fifty (50) μL of cell supernatant was aspirated. The 80 experimental
tissue samples were resuspended with 91 μL of the combined target
antibodies from the tube labeled “cocktail”. The 100 μL volumes in the
12-well V-bottom reagent reservoir were added to the respective
single-color compensation control wells; CD45 isotype antibodies were
added to the “ISO” well. Cells in the “UNS” and “FVD” wells were
resuspended with 91 μL of Brilliant Stain Buffer. The microplate was
allowed to incubate on ice in the dark for 15 minutes before adding 100
μL of DPBS to each well and mixing thoroughly with a multichannel
pipette. The plate was then centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 5
minutes at 4°C followed by aspirating 191 μL from each well. Two-hundred
(200) μL of DPBS were added to each well using a multichannel pipette
and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. The plate was centrifuged at 100 x g
(max RCF) for 5 minutes at 4°C followed by a 200 μL aspiration of
supernatant. Fixable viability dye was diluted 1.5:1,000 in 1X DPBS in
the 15 mL conical tube labeled “FVD” according to the spreadsheet
(**Supplementary Table 2**). One-hundred (100) μL of the diluted FVD
were added to each well (a 1:1,000 final dilution) except for the “UNS”,
which was resuspended with 100 μL of DPBS only. Cells were incubated on
ice in the dark for 30 minutes. One-hundred (100) μL of DPBS were then
added to each well and with a multichannel pipette and pipetted
thoroughly to wash. The plate was centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 5
minutes at 4°C followed by a 200 μL aspiration, addition of 200 μL of
DPBS using a multichannel pipette, and through mixing. The plate was
centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 5 minutes at 4°C followed by a 200
μL aspiration.

One-hundred (100) μL of a fixation/permeabilization solution were next
added to each well and immediately resuspended with a multichannel
pipette to prevent cell-to-cell crosslinking. Cells were incubated on
ice in the dark for 20 minutes followed by the addition of 100 μL of
flow buffer and thorough mixing with a multichannel pipette. The plate
was centrifuged at 100 x g (max RCF) for 5 minutes at 4°C followed by a
200 μL aspiration and resuspension with 200 μL of flow buffer. A
Microseal ‘F’ foil seal was applied to the top of the 96-well microplate
to prevent dehydration, wrapped in aluminum foil to block light, and
stored at 4°C prior to data acquisition by flow cytometry.

**PMT Calibration.** Detection channel PMT voltages were calibrated such
that the signal intensity distribution corresponding to background
autofluorescence of FVD-labeled splenocytes was on scale and to the left
of center. FVD-labeled single-color compensation control splenocytes
were run to verify that the assigned PMT voltages were compatible with
the dynamic range of each immunomarker’s expression profile (i.e. that
immunopositive cells were on scale). To prevent downstream compensation
values from exceeding 100%, optical spillover of each single-color
compensation control into off-target detection channels was checked to
ensure that peak signal intensity occurred in the target detection
channel. Sphero Rainbow Fluorescent Particles (single-positive beads)
were run to predefine tolerability ranges for laser intensity,
stability, and alignment before initiating our study so that changes in
laser emission power could be monitored and accounted for between
successive data acquisitions to prevent run-to-run variation.
Single-positive beads were gated according to the following strategy:

-   FSC-A vs. SSC-A: on single-positive beads

-   biexponential histograms of all detection channels

<!-- -->

-   An interval gate was placed around the peak in each detection
    channel to define a narrow tolerability range to calibrate to
    between runs.

**Data Acquisition.** Cytometer setup & tracking was performed using
FACSDiva CS&T research beads to optimize and standardize instrument
performance prior to each data acquisition. The 96-well V-bottom plate
containing the 80 immunolabeled experimental tissue samples and 16
optical controls was then loaded into a BD HTS affixed to a BD LSR II
SORP flow cytometer. The gating strategy used at each acquisition was as
follows:

-   FSC-A vs. SSC-A: on all events (minus RBCs/debris)

-   SSC-H vs. SSC-W: doublet discriminator

-   FSC-H vs. FSC-W: doublet discriminator

-   BUV395-A (FVD) (detected with 355 nm laser off of a 450/50 band pass
    filter) vs. FSC-A: on FVD negative cells (i.e. viable cells)

-   biexponential histograms of all detection channels

    -   laser line, band pass filter, long pass filter, antibody
        detected:

-   405 nm, 525/50, 505, V500-CD45

-   488 nm, 710/50, 690, PerCP/Cy5.5-CD45R/B220

-   355 nm, 740/35, 690, BUV737-CD11b

-   594 nm, 660/20, 640, Alexa Fluor 647-CD11c

-   488 nm, 525/50, 505, Alexa Fluor 488-CD3ε

-   405 nm, 670/35, 635, BV605-CD4

-   488 nm, 780/60, 755, PE/Cy7-CD49b

-   488 nm, 610/20, 600, PE-CF594-CD8α

-   488 nm, 575/26, 505, PE-F4/80

-   594 nm, 780/60, 735, APC/Cy7-Ly6C

-   405 nm, 780/60, 750, BV711-Ly6G

Samples were run in the following order:

1.  SP beads (PRE): to check that PMT voltages were within previously
    defined tolerability ranges prior to data acquisition.

2.  unstained control splenocytes (UNS)

3.  unstained control splenocytes labeled with FVD (FVD)

4.  control splenocytes labeled with FVD and CD45 isotype control
    antibodies (ISO)

5.  single-color compensation controls stained with FVD (control
    splenocytes were used for each antibody except CD49b, in which case
    WBCs were used due to the increased abundance of CD49b^+^ cells in
    blood)

6.  experimental samples (16 mice x 5 tissue samples = 80 total)

7.  SP beads (POST): to check that PMT voltages remained stable over the
    acquisition period (fluidic anomalies can impact laser delay
    stability)

Raw data were exported as FCS3.0 files upon completion of each data
acquisition session.

**Spectral Deconvolution and Data Pre-processing.** FlowJo software was
used to spectrally deconvolve raw flow cytometry data. Data from 15 of
the 16 optical control wells (UNS was excluded) were imported into the
*compensation group* of a new FlowJo *workspace*. CD45 signal intensity
distributions were invariably unimodal making it difficult to
objectively define a compensation gate for the CD45 single-positive
control alone. Thus, the data corresponding to well E11 (ISO) was merged
with that of F9 (CD45 single-color compensation control) using FlowJo’s
*concatenate* feature. The merged data were saved as a new FCS3.0 file
and imported into the *compensation group* of the current *workspace*.
The original CD45 single-positive compensation control and ISO samples
were then deleted from the *workspace*. The merging procedure resulted
in a bimodal distribution and the ability to objectively define a CD45
compensation gate between its two peaks. The merged CD45 file plus the
other 10 single-color compensation controls and the FVD well (E10)—which
served as the compensation control for the for the FVD itself—were gated
for viable singlets according to the following strategy:

-   FSC-A vs. SSC-A: on all events (minus RBCs/debris)

-   SSC-H vs. SSC-W: doublet discriminator

-   FSC-H vs. FSC-W: doublet discriminator

-   BUV395-A (FVD) vs. FSC-A (viewed as a contour plot at the 2% level):
    on FVD negative cells (i.e. viable cells)

-   backgate to FSC-A vs. SSC-A: on total viable singlets (or a subset
    for scarce populations)

Once gated, viable singlets of each compensation control sample were
visualized as histograms in their respective detection channel. Signal
intensity values of each histogram were bisected at the interface of the
penultimate and ultimate modes of each signal intensity distribution
using FlowJo’s *bisector tool*. Its *compensation* tool was then opened
and the subsets to the left and right of the bisection were dragged into
fields labeled *negative* and positive, respectively. The process was
repeated for all 11 antibodies plus the FVD. Next, a new *group* in the
*workspace* window was generated and titled “cocktails” to which the 80
experimental samples were imported. The finalized compensation matrix
was then applied to the “cocktails” group. Viable singlets from each
experimental sample were gated in the same way as the single-color
compensation controls according to the first 4 steps of the gating
strategy outlined above then exported as new FCS3.0 files; the aggregate
of such files from each of the study’s 3 time points served as input
into our computational data analysis algorithm.

**Weighted Random Sampling.** A 10 million cell weighted random sample
(WRS) was derived from the pre-processed flow cytometry data to help
balance the number of cells per tissue sample. Sample weights were
defined per tissue per cell according to the formula \[(1/ω) x
(1/N*~i~*)\] where ω was the number of unique tissue types (5 in this
cases) and N*~i~* was the number of events associated with the *i*^th^
tissue where *i* took the categorical values blood, marrow, nodes,
spleen, thymus.

**Histogram Gating.** Pre-processed flow cytometry data (i.e.
compensated viable singlets) were displayed as 2,640 histograms (240
samples x 11 antibody detection channels) plotted on a Logicle^56^ scale
and formatted as scalable vector graphics (SVGs) in the context of a
scrolling HTML table viewable with a web browser. A KDE of the signal
intensity distribution of cells from the FVD well (i.e. compensated
unstained viable splenocytes) was superimposed on each to identify
signal intensity values corresponding to autofluorescence background.
This allowed for the rapid recording of bisection point at the interface
of the first (autofluorescence) and second (true signal) peaks for all
histograms in a .TXT file. A vertical line was then programmatically
rendered at the location of each bisection point and again visualized as
a scrolling HTML table on the web for confirmation or refinement. The
numerical value of each bisection point was then Logicle-transformed and
subtracted from the Logicle-transformed signal intensity values of its
corresponding histogram (i.e. Logicle\[data point~i~\]) –
Logicle\[bisection point\]) resulting in the Logicle-transformed
bisection point assuming the numerical value of zero and background
signal intensity values becoming negative valued. Since the 5 lymphoid
tissue types predominately consisted of immune cells, the CD45 signal
intensity distributions were invariable unimodal with no discernable
local minima. Thus, for each time point and tissue combination, a common
CD45 bias was curated by pooling the corresponding samples, computing
Q25 – \[1.5 \* \[Q75 - Q25\]\], then rounding to the nearest multiple of
5. (where Q25 and Q75 were the first and third quartiles of the
Logicle-transformed data, respectively).

Immunophenotypes interpreted as CD49b^+^ granulocytes were identified in
the blood of both control and GBM mice. Since granulocyte interaction
with CD49b^+^ platelets is a described phenomenon thought to represent a
physiologic process required for neutrophil extracellular trap
formation^57,58^, we considered these cells as a likely artifact of
residual platelets present within blood samples. In taking a
conservative approach to correct for this discrepancy, cell status of
the CD49b immunomarkers was only considered in cases where the
immunophenotype was otherwise consistent with NK cells (e.g. CD45^+^,
CD49b^+^, CD11b^+^). Thus, a Boolean truth value of zero for the CD49b
channel was uniformly applied to all cells whose immunophenotype was not
matching NK cells.
