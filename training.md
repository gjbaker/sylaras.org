## Training

NCI-funded Cancer System Biology Centers (CSBC centers) at Harvard Medical
School and Oregon Health & Science University are collaborating to make it
possible for others to perform t-CyCIF in their own labs. This includes offering
resources through the CyCIF.org website and hands-on training sessions. We
expect that several of these sessions will be held per year.

### 2018 Multiscale Imaging at the Edge: Hands-On Workshops

On May 7-11, 2018
